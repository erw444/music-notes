                               MY OWN WORST ENEMY
                               As recorded by Lit

[Verse 1]
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me
Please tell me, Please tell me whyyyyyyyy

[Chorus]
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night
And you're gone, 
gone

[Verse 2]
It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me
The smoke alarm is going off, and there's a cigarette
Still burning, Please tell me why

[Chorus]
My car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
Came in through the window last night
And you're gone, 
gone

[Chorus]
Please tell me why 
my car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night

[Outro]
It's no surprise to me, I am my own worst enemy
'Cause every now and then, I kick the living shit out of me
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk?
I didn't mean to call you that
