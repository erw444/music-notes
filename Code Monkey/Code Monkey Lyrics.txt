							        CODE MONKEY
                               As recorded by Jonathan Coulton

Code monkey get up, get coffee
Code monkey go to job
Code monkey have boring meeting
With boring manager Rob

Rob say code monkey very diligent
But his output stink
His code not funcitonal or elegant,
What do code monkey think?
Code monkey think 
'Maybe manager wanna write goddamn login page himself!'
Code monkey not say it out loud
Code monkey not crazy, just proud

Code monkey like Frittos
Code monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew
Code monkey very simple man
With big, warm, fuzzy, secret heart
Code monkey like you
Code monkey like you

Code monkey hang around at front desk
Tell you sweater look nice
Code monkey offer buy you soda
Bring you cup, bring yoe ice
You say "No thank you for the soda 'cos
Soda make you fat.
Anyway you busy with telephone
No time for chat"
Code monkey have long walk back to cubicle
He sit down, pretend to work
Code monkey not thinking so straight
Code monkey not feeling so great

Code monkey like Frittos
Code monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew
Code monkey very simple man
With big, warm, fuzzy, secret heart
Code monkey like you
Code monkey like you - a lot

Code monkey have every reason
To get out this place
Code monkey just keep on working
See your soft, pretty face
Much rather wake up, eat a coffee cake
Take bath, take nap
This job "fulfilling in creative way" -
Such a load of crap
Code monkey says someday he have everything
Even pretty girl like you
Code monkey just waiting for now
Code monkey say some day, somehow

Code monkey like Frittos
Code monkey like Tab and Mountain Dew
Code monkey very simple man
With big, warm, fuzzy, secret heart
Code monkey like you
Code monkey like you
