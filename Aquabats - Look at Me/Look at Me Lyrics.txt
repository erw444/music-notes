							  LOOK AT ME (I'MMA WINNER)
                               As recorded by Aquabats

Yeah!
Uh huh!
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh

I've been pushed around like a jailbird
I've been left in a ditch
I never made the cut so to speak
I never even got to warm the bench

But with you I know, when that whistle blows
You keep me rockin', you keep me rockin' baby!
When I'm out on the job site
I'm thinkin' that we're gonna be alright

CHORUS: 
Be alright!
Four radios blastin' classic rock
And they're pointing at you
With your fist raised high
and a hitch in your step
You've got it all
I've got no reason to lie

Look at me look at me look at me I'm a winner
(You're a winner)
It's just as simple as that
Don't you agree don't you agree don't you agree that I'm a winner?
(You're a winner!)
You just can't argue with that
CHORUS:

Someone once told me
You can't lose em' all
And that someone was you
But when I nail gunned my hand to the wall
I started to wonder if that could be true

But babe it's me you chose
And when the whistle blows
You keep me rockin', keep me rockin' baby
And when I'm out on the job site
I'm thinkin' we're gonna be alright

CHORUS

Look at me look at me look at me I'm a winner
(You're a winner)
It's just as simple as that
Don't you agree don't you agree don't you agree that I'm a winner?
(You're a winner!)
You just can't argue with that

CHORUS
