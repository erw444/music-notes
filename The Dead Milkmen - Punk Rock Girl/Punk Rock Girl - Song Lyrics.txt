[Verse 1]
 
F                      Bb             F
One Saturday I took a walk to Zipperhead
F                                Bb                C
I met a girl there and she she almost knocked me dead
            Dm           Bb
(Punk rock girl) Please look at me
            Am        Bb
(Punk rock girl) What do you see?
       F      C         Dm        Bb       C             F
Let's travel round the world just you and me punk rock girl
 
F                                     Bb              F
I tapped her on the shoulder and said do you have a beau?
F                                Bb                C
She looked at me and smiled and said she did not know
            Dm        Bb
(Punk rock girl) Give me a chance
            Am         Bb
(Punk rock girl) Let's go slamdance
       F           C     Dm         Bb     C              F
We'll dress like Minnie Pearl just you and me punk rock girl
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C         G                   C           G               C
We went to the Philly Pizza Company and ordered some hot tea
G                       C      G            C
The waitress said "Well no we only have it iced"
        G                C          G        C
So we jumped up on the table and shouted "anarchy"
       G              C              G           C
And someone played a Beach Boys song on the jukebox
            G          C    G                  C
It was "California Dreamin" so we started screamin'
G                    C     C/E  C/G  Bb  Bb/A  Bb/G
"On such a winter's day"
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
F                           Bb            F
She took me to her parents for a Sunday meal
F                                  Bb            C
Her father took one look at me and he began to squeal
            Dm       Bb
(Punk rock girl) It makes no sense
                       Am         Bb
(Punk rock girl) Your dad is the Vice President
       F     C      Dm           Bb       C              F
Rich as the Duke of Earl yeah, you're for me punk rock girl
 
 
[Solo]
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C       G              C          G                  C
We went to a shopping mall and laughed at all the shoppers
G                      C       G            C
And security guards trailed us to a record shop
     G              C         G                   C
We asked for Mojo Nixon they said "He don't work here"
         G                     C           G                          C
We said "If you don't got Mojo Nixon then your store could use some fixin"
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
F                      Bb              F
We got into her car, away we started rollin'
F                                             Bb                   C
I said "How much you pay for this?" she said "Nothing man, it's stolen"
            Dm        Bb
(Punk rock girl) You look so wild
            Am         Bb
(Punk rock girl) Let's have a child
       F        C      Dm
We'll name her Minnie Pearl
      Bb     C          F      C     Dm
Just you and me eating fudge banana swirl
      Bb     C          F      C        Dm
Just you and me we'll travel round the world
      Bb     C              F
