[Verse 1]
Can't explain all the feelings that you're making me feel
My heart's in overdrive and you're behind the steering wheel

[Pre-Chorus]
Touching you
Touching me
Touching you, God, you're touching me

[Chorus]
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it, now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh
Huh

[Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
I wanna kiss you every minute, every hour, every day
You got me in a spin, but everythin' is a-okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Touching you
Touching me
Touching you, God, you're touching me

[Chorus]
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it, now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Ooh

Guitar!

[Solo 2]

[Pre-Chorus]
Touching you
Touching me
Touching you, God, you're touching me
Oh

[Chorus]
I believe in a thing called love
Just listen to the rhythm of my heart
There's a chance we could make it, now
We'll be rocking 'til the sun goes down
I believe in a thing called love
Oh!
