[Intro]
Well, they say the world's your oyster
Man, but oysters ain't for me
You're the belle of the ball
But you ain't my cup of tea

They always vote you Best in Show
But this doggie disagrees
'Cause I like life in Paddy's Pub...

[Verse]
There's a place for me, it's the place I go
Where the beer is cheap, and the lights are low
It's Paddy's Pub
I like Paddy's Pub
Let the record show
The greatest place to go
Is that bar called Paddy's Pub...

[Harmonica Solo]

[Outro]
I like life in Paddy's Pub...
