[Verse 1]
I feel uptight on a Saturday night
Nine o'clock, the radio's the only light
I hear my song, and it pulls me through
Comes on strong, tells me what I got to do
I got to

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
You gotta lose your mind in Detroit Rock City
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

[Verse 2]
Getting late, I just can't wait
Ten o'clock and I know I gotta hit the road
First I drink, then I smoke
Start the car and I try to make the midnight show

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

[Verse 3]
Moving fast, down 95
Hit top speed, but I'm still moving much too slow
I feel so good, I'm so alive
Hear my song playing on the radio, it goes

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get down!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat

[Instrumental break 3:54-4:35]

[Verse 4]
Twelve o'clock, I gotta rock
There's a truck ahead, lights staring at my eyes
Oh my God, no time to turn
I got to laugh 'cause I know I'm gonna die
Why?

[Chorus]
Get up!
Everybody's gonna move their feet
Get up!
Everybody's gonna leave their seat
Get up
