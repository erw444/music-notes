And this I know his teeth as white as snow
What a gas it was to see him
Walk her every day into a shady place
With her lips she said

She said, "Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul"
"Let's have a ball"
"Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul"
"Let's have a ball"
"Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul"
"Let's have a ball"

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Lovely legs there are

What a big black mass, what a hunk of love
He'll walk her every day into a shady place
He's like the dark, but I'd want him

"Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul"
"Let's have a ball"
"Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul"
"Let's have a ball"
"Hey Paul, hey Paul, hey Paul"
"Let's have a ball"

Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
Gigantic, gigantic, gigantic
A big, big love
