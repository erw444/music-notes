[Intro]
Right now

[Verse 1]
I am an Antichrist
I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want but I know how to get it
I wanna destroy the passersby

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I wanna be anarchy
No dogsbody
[Verse 2]
Anarchy for the U.K., it's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I wanna be anarchy
In the city

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
How many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the N.M.E
I use anarchy

[Chorus]
'Cause I, I wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Is this the M.P.L.A.?
Or is this the U.D.A.?
Or is this the I.R.A.?
I thought it was the U.K
Or just another country
Another council tenancy

[Outro]
I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
Know what I mean?
And I wanna be anarchist
I get pissed, destroy
