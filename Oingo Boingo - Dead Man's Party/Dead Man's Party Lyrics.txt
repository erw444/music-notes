                               Dead Man's Party
                               From Oingo Boingo Farewell 1995 Tour
                               
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Walkin' with a dead man over my shoulder
I'm all dressed up with nowhere to go
Walkin' with a dead man over my shoulder
Don't Run away, it's only me

Waiting for an invitation to arrive
Goin' to a party where no one's still alive
Waiting for an invitation to arrive
Goin' to a party where no one's still alive

I was struck by lighting, walkin' down the street
I was hit by something last night in my sleep
It's a dead man's party who could ask for more?
Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door
Leave your body and soul at the door

Don't run away it's only me
Only me~~~~~
Only me

I'm all dressed up, nowhere to go
Walkin' with a dead man (oh!) with a dead man
Ooh ooh, waitin' for an invitation to arrive
Ooh! Walkin' with a dead man, dead man (with a dead man)

I got my best suit and my tie
shiny silver dollar on either eye
I hear the chauffeur comin' to my door
Says there's room for maybe just one more

I was struck by lighting, walkin' down the street
I was hit by something last night in my sleep
It's a dead man's party, who could ask for more?
Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door
Leave your body and soul at the door

Don't run away it's only me
Don't be afraid of what you can't see
Don't run away it's only me
Don't be afraid of what you can't see

It's only me

Solo

I was struck by lighting, walkin' down the street
I was hit by something last night in my sleep
It's a dead man's party, who could ask for more?
Everybody's comin', leave your body at the door
Leave your body and soul at the door

Don't run away it's only me (only me)
Don't be afraid of what you can't see
Don't run away it's only me (only me)
Don't be afraid of what you can't see

It's only me
It's only me
Only me
It's only me
It's only me
Only me (only me)
It's only me
It's only me
Ow!
