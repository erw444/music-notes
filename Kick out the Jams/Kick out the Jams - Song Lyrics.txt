                            Kick out the Jams by MC5

[Intro: Rob Tyner]
And right now...
Right now...
Right now, it's time to...
Kick out the jams, motherfuckers!

Intro riff


Yeah! I, I, I, I, I'm gonna
I'm gonna kick 'em out! Yeah!

Play 4x verse riff 

[Verse 1]
Well, I feel pretty good
And I guess that I could get crazy now, baby
'Cause we all got in tune
And when the dressing room got hazy now, baby
I know how you want it, child
Hot, quick and tight
The girls can't stand it
When you're doin' it right

[Chorus]
Let me up on the stand
And let me kick out the jam
Yes, kick out the jams
I want to kick 'em out

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm starting to sweat
You know my shirt's all wet, what a feeling
In the sound that abounds
And resounds and rebounds off the ceiling

You gotta have it, baby
You can't do without
When you get that feeling
You gotta sock 'em out

[Chorus 2]
Put that mic in my hand
And let me kick out the jam
Yes! Kick out the jams
I want to kick 'em out
[Ad libs]
Ah..Oohhh...
Yeah Ha
Alright....baby...
Alright, alright, alright, alright, come on...
Alright, alright, alright, yeah
Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh

[Verse 3]
So you got to give it up
You know you can't get enough, Miss McKenzie
'Cause it gets in your brain
It drives you insane with the frenzy

The wigglin' guitars, girl
The crash of the drums
Make you wanna keep-a-rockin'
'Til morning comes

[Chorus 3]
Let me be who I am
And let me kick out the jam
Yes, kick out the jams
I done kicked 'em out!
