Yesterday I heard you say
Your lust for life has gone away
It got me thinking, I think I feel a similar way
And that's sad
(That's sad)
That's sad

So let's make a decision, start a new religion
Yeah, we're gonna build a temple to our love
Orgiastic dances, nymphs in trances
Yeah, we'll be the envy of the gods above

I'm feeling devious
You're looking glamorous
Let's get mischievous
And polyamorous
Wine and women and wonderful vices
Welcome to the cult of Dionysus

We could take a holiday in the month of May
Run free and play in fields of flowers
Pass the hours making love is how we'll pray

Or start a secret society for the wild and free
Our ideology is "You can do what you want
Too much is never enough"
We are the light, we are the life
We are the envy of the gods above

I'm feeling devious
You're looking glamorous
Let's get mischievous
And polyamorous
Wine and women and wonderful vices
Welcome to the cult of Dionysus

Run, run, run away
Just take my hand and we'll abandon this world
We'll wash those tears away
You're young and beautiful, and I'll love you always
We got no time for pain
When it's just you and me in ecstasy, hey

What is with the world today
The wicked games that people play
The wars, the greed, they waste away
Yeah, it's sad
(It's sad)
It's sad

So let's spread the word across the land
Yeah, one by one, baby, hand in hand
We got a mission of hope
We got message of love
Soon everybody everywhere will be
The envy of the gods above

I'm feeling devious
You're looking glamorous
Let's get mischievous
And polyamorous
Wine and women and wonderful vices
Welcome to the cult of Dionysus

I'm feeling devious
You're looking glamorous
Let's get mischievous
And polyamorous
Wine and women and wonderful vices
Welcome to the cult of Dionysus
