[Verse 1]
In the still of the night, I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the still of the night, I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

In the shadow of night, I see the full moon rise
Telling me what's in store
My heart start aching, my body start-a shaking
And I can't take no more

No, no, no

[Chorus]
Now I just wanna get close to you
And taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat
In the still of the night
In the still of the night

Over here, baby

[Verse 2]
In the heat of the day, I hang my head down low
And hide my face from the sun
Through the light of the day until the evening time
Waiting for the night to c-c-c-come

Ooh, baby

[Bridge]
In the still of the night
In the cool moonlight
I feel my heart is aching
In the still of the night

[Breakdown]
Ooh, baby
Ooh, babe
I can't keep away
Closer and closer, need to be closer
I can't keep away, can't keep away, can't keep away
I can't keep away, no
You gotta give me love
Got to give me some lovin' everyday
Can't keep away

[Instrumental Break]

Ooh baby, ooh woman
Ahh

[Guitar Solo]
Get over here, babe

[Verse 3]
In the still of the night, I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the still of the night, I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more

Ooh! Mama

[Chorus]
Now I just wanna get close to you
Taste your love so sweet
And I just wanna make love to you
Feel your body heat
In the still of the night, ooh yeah

[Outro]
In the still of the night
I will be sneaking 'round your door
In the still of the night
In the still of the night
Ain't nothing gonna stop me now

Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
