Intro

I am a patient boy
I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait
My time, water down a drain
Everybody's moving
Everybody's moving
Everybody's moving, moving, moving, moving
Please don't leave me to remain

In the waiting room

I don't want the news
Backup: I cannot use it

I don't want the news
Backup: I won't live by it

Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down
Backup: Tell me why?
Because they can't get up

Backup: Come on and get up
Backup: Come on and get up


But I don't sit idly by
I'm planning a big surprise
I'm gonna fight for what I wanna be
And I won't make the same mistakes ('cause I know)
Because I know how much time that wastes (and function)
Function is the key

To the waiting room

I don't want the news
Backup: I cannot use it

I don't want the news
Backup: I won't live by it

Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down
Backup: Tell me why?
Because they can't get up

Backup: Come on and get up

Up from the waiting room

Sitting in the waiting room (ah)
Sitting in the waiting room (ah)
Sitting in the waiting room (ah)
Sitting in the waiting room (tell me why)
Because they can't get up
