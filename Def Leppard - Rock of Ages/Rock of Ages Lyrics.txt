[Intro]
Hm hm hm, tsk, tsk, tsk
All right, yeah
I got something to say
Yeah, it's better to burn out
Yeah, than fade away
All right
Ow
Gonna start a fire
C'mon

[Verse 1]
Rise up, gather round
Rock this place to the ground
Burn it up, let's go for broke
Watch the night go up in smoke

[Verse 2]
Rock on (Rock on)
Drive me crazier
No serenade, no fire brigade
Just the pyromania, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
(What do ya want?) What do ya want?
(I want rock 'n' roll) Yes, I do
(Long live rock 'n' roll)

[Verse 3]
Oh, let's go let's strike a light
We're gonna blow like dynamite
I don't care if it takes all night
Gonna set this town alight, c'mon

[Pre-Chorus]
(What do ya want?) What do ya want?
(I want rock 'n' roll) All right
(Long live rock 'n' roll) Oh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Rock of ages, rock of ages
Still rollin', keep a-rollin'
Rock of ages, rock of ages
Still rollin', rock 'n' rollin'

[Bridge 1]
We got the power, got the glory
Just say you need it
And if you need it say yeah (Yeah!)
Oh, yeah, heh heh heh heh
Now listen to me

[Verse 4]
I'm burnin', burnin', I got the fever
I know for sure, there ain't no cure
So feel it, don't fight it, go with the flow
And gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme one more for the road, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
(What do ya want?) What do ya want?
(I want rock 'n' roll) You betcha
(Long live rock 'n' roll) Now hit it

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Rock of ages, rock of ages
Still rollin', keep a-rollin'
Rock of ages, rock of ages
Still rollin', rock 'n' rollin'

[Bridge 2]
We got the power, got the glory
Just say you need it
And if you need it say yeah (Yeah!)
Say yeah (Yeah!)

[Outro]
We're gonna burn this damn place down, woo-hoo
Down to the ground
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh
