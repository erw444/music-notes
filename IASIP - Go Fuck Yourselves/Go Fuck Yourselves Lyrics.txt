There's a spider (spider, spider...)
He's deep in my soul (soul...)
He's lived here for years (years...)
He just won't let go

He's laying around
He's got a mean bite
Now he's ready to fight...
And stand up for what he knows...

I don't need your trophies or your gold
I just want to tell you all
Go fuck yourselves...
Go fuck yourselves...
Go fuck yourselves...
I really mean to tell you
Fuck you motherfuckers, I don't need you in my bar...
